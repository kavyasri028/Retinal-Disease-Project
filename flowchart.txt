7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Upload an image for analysis
10. The given input is preprocessed 
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result
12. Final Outcome is display 

Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the EyeNet Master dataset with CNN, got 95% of accuracy, 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other techniques such as MobileNet, Xception for Classification 
and MobileNet + Xception, gtom which MObileNet and Xception got 97 and 99% of accuracy respectively,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
